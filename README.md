## Requirements ##
You will need Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or an alternative such as Mono. In the case of Mono, you will need the following referenced assemblies:

* System
* System.Drawing
* System.Windows.Forms

If you use Mono, you may need to comment out `[EditorControl(typeof(TextureChunk))]` in CrashEdit/TextureChunkBox.cs and recompile. __Note: doing so will disable the texture viewer.__

## Installation ##
Just unzip into a directory and run the exe.
