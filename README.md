The first game (crash 1) is not currently supported.

## Features ##
Currently, this program is not capable of modifying any game files. The current feature set includes:

* Extracting sound effects in wave format
* Extracting speech in wave format
* Extracting music sequences in SEQ or MIDI format
* Extracting most data in a binary format

## Requirements ##
You will need Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or an alternative such as Mono __(untested)__. In the case of Mono, you will need the following referenced assemblies:

* System
* System.Drawing
* System.Windows.Forms

## Installation ##
Just unzip into a directory and run the exe.
