__This software is deprecated.__

[A new editor, DRNSF][1], is being developed to replace CrashEdit.

DRNSF does not yet have adequate replacements for all of the functionality and
features in CrashEdit. For this reason, CrashEdit may continue to receive some
minor development support such as bugfixes and features.

This version of CrashEdit is based on [ManDude's fork][2] of the original
CrashEdit. Many of the new features you may find in this version are developed
by ManDude.

You can find the previous version of the README file at `README-old.md`.
